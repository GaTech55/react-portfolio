## Description

The purpose of this app was to update the portfolio that I created earlier in the class to use React. Previously the website used only HTML and CSS while now it uses React. Along with using React I also had to use Hashrouter for the different routes that were used. Overall this new portfolio uses some of the latest technologies.

## Acceptance-Criteria

```md
## Requirements

- Updated portfolio featuring 6 total projects

- Use React

- A `Header` component that appears on multiple pages

- A single `Project` component that will be used multiple times on a single page

- Navigation with React Router, dynamic rendering, or another third part router

- A `Footer` component that appears on multiple pages

- Update GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring those same projects

- Deploy this site to GitHub Pages using the [Create React App docs for deployment.](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages)

- **Important**: Be sure to push your codebase to GitHub and **NOT** your built and deployed code. Ensure this happens by following the above instructions and using the `gh-pages` branch to host the deployed application's code.
